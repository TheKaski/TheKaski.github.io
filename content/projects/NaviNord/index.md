summaryText = "In this project I worked as a member of staff for a Virtual reality research project studying spatial awareness and learning in immersive virtual environment featuring natural walk, realistic forest environment, and multisensory stimulus (audio, visual and olfactory). Along this research I wrote my master's thesis studying immersiveness of different walking locomotions (Natural walking, omnidirectional treadmill (The Omnideck) and omnidirectional slidemill (The KATVR))"

# Introduction

This project taught me a lot about VR technology and development. I became familiar with C# programming language, Unity tools, Meta Quest software and Steam VR. I had to familiarize myself with omnidirectional treadmill and slidemill as well as the two headsets: Meta Quest 3 and HTC Vive Pro. My responsibilities included planning, developing, optimizing and testing the software. I also assisted during data collection phase with the test subjects who were placed in the virtual environment for approximately 2 hours while doing various tasks in VR measuring spatial awareness, cognition and learning. Development of the software required learning new skills fast, working with a team efficiently and mapping requirements of the software as the project progressed. Besides the software side of things I learned a lot about working with a multilingual team, academic research practices and working with end users of the software. During the development phase I wrote my master's thesis in 6 months studying levels of immersion of the differenct walking techniques.

# The project

The project used the following hardware:

1. Meta Quest 3 Headset
2. HTC Vive Pro Headset
3. The Omnideck Omnidirectional treadmill
4. KATVR omnidirectional slidemill
5. AromaJoin Aromashootter

The virtual environment was powered by Unity and development included creating the 3D realistic forest environment, interractable 3D menus and developping the data collection method. Additionally the project included a benchmarking mode for testing performance differences between different hardware combinations and a recovery seed system for recovering the randomized order of landmarks for each participant in case of errors. The environment contained multiple tasks collecting data from the performance of each participant. This data was stored in separate .csv file identified and created for each participant. The code was stored in a private GitHub repository where also a Kanban board was used to track different tasks around the project.
