    <p>In this project I worked as a member of staff for a Virtual reality research project studying spatial awareness and learning in immersive virtual environment featuring natural walk, realistic forest environment, and multisensory stimulus (audio, visual and olfactory). Along this research I wrote my master&#39;s thesis studying immersiveness of different walking locomotions (Natural walking, omnidirectional treadmill (The Omnideck) and omnidirectional slidemill (The KATVR))

    <p>In this project I created my first portfolio page from scratch using HUGO framework. If you are reading this there is a high chance you are viewing this page right now. If you want to know more about this project you can read the full article

    <p>Erlchat is  a project combining my knowledge with modern frontend frameworks, websocket communication protocol and distributed systems architecture with Erlang. This project showcases sending and receiving messages via a websocket by using a distributed backend server to broadcast messages and keep a record of currently active clients.

    <p>In this project I implemented a standalone cycling speedometer with custom software and 3D printed housing. The device tracks important metrics for cylcing which are speed, avg speed, cadence, and distance. It supports showing the data  on a 7-segment led display and transmitting data over BLE communication protocol to third party mobile applications. The BLE support allows to pair this device with many thirdparty fitness applications making it easy to gather and review cycling metrics

    <p>In the winter holiday I wanted to do some bird spotting but had zero equipment to do that. I had to develop a DIY solution for a fun problem and got some good results with it
